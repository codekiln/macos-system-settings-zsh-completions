# Rules for editing Markdown files
These rules apply when modifying .md files in the codebase.

## Nesting Code Blocks in Markdown
When editing markdown files that need to show code blocks:
- Wrap the markdown file's content in a backtick-delimited fenced code block
- For code snippets within the markdown, use tilde-delimited (~~~) fenced blocks

<EXAMPLE> 
```markdown

Now I want to have a fenced code block: 
~~~bash
open .
~~~~
```
</EXAMPLE>
