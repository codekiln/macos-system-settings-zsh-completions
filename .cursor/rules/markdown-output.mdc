# Be careful when nesting markdown fenced code blocks
- Wrap the beginning and end of your answer in a backtick-delimited fenced code block
- If there are code snippets, do not wrap the beginning and end of your answers inside backticks. Instead, wrap the code snippet in a fenced code blocks that is delimited with three tilde characters. 

<EXAMPLE> 
```markdown

Now I want to have a fenced code block: 
~~~bash
open .
~~~~
```
